# AutoEmailAI - Demo Page

This repository contains the source code for the demo page of the AutoEmailAI project.

## About the Project

This repository hosts the front-end demo page for AutoEmailAI. It showcases the user interface and provides a glimpse into the capabilities of the application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice about Source Code Availability

Please note that this repository only contains the code for the public-facing demo page. The source code for the following components is **not** shared publicly:

*   User Registration System
*   User Dashboard
*   Backend Logic

There are several critical reasons for this decision, primarily related to business security, proprietary information, and legal compliance.

### üîí Core of the Business Model
The backend code and business logic are the heart of our business. Sharing this code would be risky, as it is the core of our business model and could be easily copied.

### üíº Proprietary Logic
Our application includes unique features and proprietary logic that set it apart from the competition. To maintain our competitive advantage, this logic must remain confidential.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Licensing and Data Privacy
The application uses various data sources, models, and external code. We must be careful to comply with all licensing agreements and protect user data and privacy, which prevents us from making the entire codebase public.

We appreciate your understanding.
